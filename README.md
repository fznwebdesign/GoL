Game of Live 1.0
===

This is my implementation of the Game of Live, created as a jQuery Plugin (based on jQuery v2.0.3 but it may work with previous versions).

I tried to create an interface as simple as possible, a wide set of customizable settings and interaction controls.

The package includes an implementation example with custom (but not required) CSS.

The script includes a demo with the basic "Glider" pattern that will travel endlessly across the grid. Also includes a "Edit" mode where the user is able to draw his/her own patterns and give them life.

Please feel free to inspect the code, comment, request updates or report bugs, I had a lot of fun coding this game :).

Note: I apologize in advance for the rawness of my code, I haven't had the time to optimize it and make the appropriate tests.
